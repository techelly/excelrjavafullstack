		 * In Java, inner class refers to the class that is declared inside 
		 * class or interface which were mainly introduced, to sum up, 
		 * same logically relatable classes as Java is purely object-oriented 
		 * so bringing it closer to the real world. Now as a programmer 
		 * we must be wondering why they were introduced? 
		 * There are certain advantages associated with inner classes 
		 * are as follows:
		 * Making code clean and readable.
		 * Private methods of the outer class can be accessed, so bringing a 
		 * new dimension and making it closer to the real world.
		 * Optimizing the code module.
		 * 
		 * There are four types of inner clases :
		 * 1. Non-static nested class (inner class)
		 * 	Member inner class - A class created within the class and outside method
		 * Anonymous inner class - A class created for implementing an interface or extending class. The Java compiler decides its name
		 * Local inner class -  A class create with in the method
		 * 2. Static nested class - An interface created within class or interface
